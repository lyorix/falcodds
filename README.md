The Death Star - the Empire's ultimate weapon - is almost operational and is currently approaching the Endor planet. The countdown has started.

Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia and C3PO are currently on Tatooine boarding on the Millenium Falcon. They must reach Endor to join the Rebel fleet and destroy the Death Star before it annihilates the planet.

The Empire has hired the best bounty hunters in the galaxy to capture the Millenium Falcon and stop it from joining the rebel fleet...
